This is an educational project dedicated to demonstrating the N-Queens problem using the backtracking algorithm. This repository provides an interactive exploration of the N-Queens problem, allowing visitors to learn how backtracking works to find all possible solutions.

The goal of it is to provide an in-depth understanding of the N-Queens problem, a popular example used to teach backtracking algorithms. This project includes:

A detailed explanation of the N-Queens problem.
A step-by-step walkthrough of how the backtracking algorithm solves it.
Interactive visualizations to help users understand each step of the algorithm.

What is the N-Queens Problem?
The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial puzzle where the objective is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. This means:

No two queens share the same row.
No two queens share the same column.
No two queens share the same diagonal.
The problem is typically solved using a backtracking approach, which incrementally builds a solution and backtracks when it reaches an invalid state.
