<h1>N Queens Problem Simulator 🏰👑
	
Welcome to N Queens Problem Simulator — an educational project dedicated to demonstrating the N-Queens problem using the powerful 🧠 backtracking algorithm! This repository provides an interactive exploration of the N-Queens problem, allowing visitors to learn how backtracking works to find all possible solutions. 🎯

<h2>🚀 Project Goal
	
The goal of N Queens Problem Simulator is to provide an in-depth understanding of the N-Queens problem, a popular example used to teach backtracking algorithms. 📚✨
This project includes:
	📝 A detailed explanation of the N-Queens problem.
	🔍 A step-by-step walkthrough of how the backtracking algorithm solves it.
	🎨 Interactive visualizations to help users understand each step of the algorithm.

<h2>🤔 What is the N-Queens Problem?
	
The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial puzzle 🧩 where the objective is to place N queens 👸 on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.
This means:
  🚫 No two queens share the same row.
	🚫 No two queens share the same column.
  🚫 No two queens share the same diagonal.
The problem is typically solved using a backtracking approach, which incrementally builds a solution and backtracks 🕵️‍♂️ when it reaches an invalid state.
